Once you have completed the game, you unlock the *Forge of Hephaestus*, located on the highest peak of *Mount Olympus*.

Each successive climb grants you one attempt to forge a piece of equipment upon the anvil, along with [legend rewards](/compendium/miscellaneous#legend-rewards) for every tenth ascent.
