## Stats

Stats can be separated into [vital stats](#vital-stats), [primary stats](#primary-stats) and [secondary stats](#secondary-stats).

- **Vital stats** are the most important to watch and may fluctuate frequently.
- **Primary stats** shape your overall development.
- **Secondary stats** affect your potency in battle.

### Vital Stats

You gain *XP* from defeating enemies. You gain more XP when the enemies you defeat are closer to your level or above it.

Each time you level up, you gain 20 *HP* and 20 *EP*, and your HP and EP are fully restored.

|Stat|Effect
|-|-|
|XP|Allows you to level up when you accumulate enough of it.
|HP|Keeps you alive.
|EP|Allows you to use skills.

### Primary Stats

Each time you level up, you gain 5 *Stat Points* to distribute among *Strength*, *Dexterity* and *Wisdom*.

Each of the three primary stats increases your damage dealt with one or more weapon types, and increases one or more secondary stats.

A stat needs to be high enough in order to wield a particular piece of [equipment](#equipment).

|Stat|Weapons Empowered|Secondary Bonuses|
|-|-|-|
|Strength|Mace, sword, axe, spear|Critical damage|
|Dexterity|Bow|Accuracy, critical chance, block chance|
|Wisdom|Wand|Elemental reduction|

### Secondary Stats

These stats are derived from your primary stats and the equipment you wield (and [passive items](#passive-bonuses) you hold).

|Stat|Effect|
|-|-|
|Accuracy|Determines chance to hit.|
|Base Damage|ðŸš§ TBD|
|Average Damage|ðŸš§ TBD|
|Critical Chance|Determines chance to land a critical hit.|
|Critical Damage|Determines critical hit damage compared to a regular attack.|
|Defence|Decreases damage taken by a *flat value*. Calculated before reductions.<br />{::nomarkdown}<details><summary class="bar-descriptor"><em>Flat value?</em></summary>Every point of defence will reduce damage taken by one point.</details>{:/nomarkdown}|
|Reduction|Decreases damage taken by a *percentage*. Calculated after defence.|
|Block Chance|Determines chance to nullify an enemy attack against you.|

---

## Skills

Most skills require a certain weapon type to be equipped in order to use them in [battle](#battle). Skills consume EP when used.

You may keep up to *4* skills. To get another skill after four, you must relinquish one that you already have.

### Stat-Altering Skills

Some skills alter user stats and/or opponent stats.

Stats will return to their original values after

- Battle
- Changing equipment in battle.

---

## Items

Items serve a variety of purposes. The two major categories of items are [equipment](#equipment) and [miscellaneous](#miscellaneous-items).

You may carry up to *9* items, unless you have the [Chasmic Rucksack](miscellaneous#chasmic-rucksack), which allows you to carry up to *16*.

### Equipment

In general, you can wield 1 [weapon](weapons), 1 piece of [armour](armour) and 1 [shield](shields) at a time. However, if you wield a [bow](weapons#bows), you may not wield a shield under most circumstances.

You must meet the stat requirement of a piece of equipment in order to wield it.

#### Modified Equipment

Sometimes an enemy will drop a piece of equipment with a modifier (prefix). This is a regular piece of equipment with an additional enhancement.

|Modifier Name|Stat Enhanced|Enhancement Amount|
|-|-|
|Exotic|Sell price|+100% to +300%|
|Big|Power|+2 to +4|
|Keen|Critical chance|+1% to +2%|
|Stony|Earth reduction|+2% to +4%|
|Icy|Water reduction|+2% to +4%|
|Fiery|Fire reduction|+2% to +4%|
|Sturdy|Defence|+2 to +4|
|Heavy|Block chance|+1% to +2%|
|Giant|Power|+4 to +8|
|Deadly|Critical chance|+2% to +4%|
|Gaian|Earth reduction|+4% to +8%|
|Glacial|Water reduction|+4% to +8%|
|Molten|Fire reduction|+4% to +8%|
|Robust|Defence|+4 to +8|
|Massive|Block chance|+2% to +4%|

### Miscellaneous Items

[Miscellaneous items](miscellaneous) cannot be equipped (except for the [Scintillous Ring](miscellaneous#scintillous-ring)), but they are useful in other ways.

- [**Quest items**](miscellaneous#quest-items) help you make progress by aiding you in getting past obstacles.
- [**Consumable items**](miscellaneous#consumables) help you in battle. Some are consumed and activated with a regular attack.

### Elemental Ailments

Elemental attacks that deal damage (except for Poison Ivy) have a chance to inflict an ailment upon the target. Ailments are removed after battle.

Elementally-imbued weapons in general do not inflict ailments. However, *lightning weapons* are special: While wielding one, non-elemental attacks have a chance of inflicting paralysis.

|Skill Element|Ailment|Effect|
|-|-|-|
|Earth|30% chance to be *grounded*|Lose one turn.|
|Lightning|20% chance to be *paralyzed*|Lose turns until recovery. 50% chance of recovery each turn.|
|Poison|100% chance to be *poisoned*|Take damage equal to approximately 2% of your max HP each turn.|
|Water|50% chance to *drown* when you lose 50% max HP from the attack|Die immediately.|
|Ice|15% chance to *freeze*|Lose turns until recovery. 25% chance of recovery each turn.|
|Fire|25% chance to *ignite*|Take damage equal to approximately 25% of damage dealt by the original igniting attack each turn until recovery. 25% chance of recovery each turn.|
|Petrification|100% chance to be *petrified*|Lose turns until recovery. 25% chance of recovery each turn.|

#### Additional Notes

- If you ignite while frozen, you will no longer be frozen, and vice versa.
- If you are petrified while paralyzed and/or frozen, you will no longer be paralyzed and/or frozen.

## Battle

Battles may occur randomly while travelling, or as a result of events that happen.

In battle, combatants consistently take turns using moves.

### Turn Order

In general, you or the enemy are randomly selected to take the first turn. However, if you are wielding a bow, you will always go first.

### Moves

There are *3* basic combat moves always available to you.

- **Attacking (![Sword](/assets/img/icons/attack.gif))** strikes the enemy with your equipped weapon.
- **Defending (![Shield](/assets/img/icons/defend.gif))** increases your chance to block the next attack by 25% and restores EP. If the next attack is successfully blocked, you gain an EP boost.
  <details markdown=1 style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;"><summary class="bar-descriptor"><em>How much EP?</em></summary>
  
  - EP restored = 5 + `wisdom`<sup>0.75</sup>
  - EP boost = 1 + 9 Ã— âˆš`blocked damage`
  
  </details>
- **Running away (![Running Man](/assets/img/icons/flee.gif))** attempts to flee from battle. If your level is not higher than the enemy's, there is a chance that the enemy will catch up.
  <details markdown=1><summary class="bar-descriptor"><em>What's the chance to flee?</em></summary>
  
  - Chance to flee = 100% / (2 + `enemy level` - `your level`)
  
  |Level Difference|Chance to Flee|
  |-|-|
  |0|50%|
  |1|33%|
  |2|25%|
  |3|20%|
  |4|16%|
  |5|14%|
  |...|...|
  |10|8%|
  
  </details>

There are *2* special moves available in battle. These actions can also be performed outside of battle.

- **Changing equipment (![Body Armour](/assets/img/icons/inventory.gif))** allows you to use a turn to equip a different item from your inventory. You will take an additional turn to recover.
- **Drinking a potion (![Potion](/assets/img/icons/potion.gif))** restores HP. It requires that you have at least one vial of life fluid.
  <details markdown=1><summary class="bar-descriptor"><em>How much HP?</em></summary>
  
  - HP restored = 50 + 10 Ã— âˆš`character level` - 10
  
  </details>
  
In addition to the five moves mentioned, you may use any of your [skills](#skills) for which you meet the requirements.
