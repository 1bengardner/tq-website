## Overview

After defeating [*Niplin*](/compendium/enemies#niplin) and absorbing the power of the [*Ominous Orb*](/compendium/miscellaneous#ominous-orb) in the Hidden Passage altar, you may take on one of four specializations. The four specializations that you qualify for depend on your [class](/classes).

### Perks and Bonuses

Each specialization has a *perk* and a *bonus*. The perk remains constant. However, the bonus gets stronger as you defeat more enemies. Every enemy you defeat gets you closer to *ranking up*. Every time you rank up, your specialization's bonus increases.

### Re-Specializing

After you have reached Rank 2 in a given specialization, you may re-specialize. For a new specialization, your rank will start at 1.

If you re-specialize back to a previously-held specialization, your rank will be retained. That is, you will never lose ranks you have earned for a given specialization.
