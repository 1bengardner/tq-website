*Nymph-nodes* are secluded nooks scattered throughout the <span class="compendium-link">[world](world-map)</span>. Their interconnectedness offers a means of transportation.

- The network of nymph-nodes allows you to fast-travel between different areas.
- You need a certain amount of dexterity to enter a given node.
- Once you have entered a node, you can access it from other nodes in the network.
- Leaving a node will return you to the original location where you found it.
- Finding every nymph-node on a single character will waive the entry dexterity requirement for all nodes for all characters.
